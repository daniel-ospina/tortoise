"""Retired public SDK method names and their replacements (#4282 phase 2).

The owner ruled (#3836, option (c), 2026-09-23) that a retired SDK name must **fail
and name its replacement** — there is deliberately NO alias layer and NO warning shim.
``TortoiseSDK.__getattr__`` consults :data:`RETIRED_SDK_METHODS` and raises an
``AttributeError`` naming where the caller should go instead.

**OVERRIDES:** the industry default and our own earlier ruling (#3836 (b)) — *old names
keep working and warn through the beta* — is overridden: a retired name FAILS with a
migration hint rather than resolving. Reason: the warn-and-continue behaviour existed
solely to harvest telemetry on which retired names were still called, and with zero
users there is no telemetry to harvest and no caller to protect.

WHY THIS IS A SMALL HAND-KEPT MAP, NOT A READ OF THE MIGRATION TABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------
``tools/sdk_rename_table.py`` is the migration map: all 150 current names and their
approved destinations, most of whose renames have **not** landed yet. Two reasons this
map is separate and deliberately tiny:

  * a product module must not import a build tool, and that table reads two product docs
    at import time;
  * the table maps names that still EXIST. This map holds only names that have **already
    left** the surface — the ones ``__getattr__`` will actually be asked about.

``tests/test_sdk_retirement.py`` pins every entry here to the owner-approved
``docs/product/beta-sdk-surface.md`` — each name carries the ledger region that
authorises it (``RETIRED_SDK_APPROVALS``), and the gate checks that the region is
present VERBATIM in that document, that it names the retired name, and that the
replacement is one of the numbered target rows the region points at. An entry cannot
be added here that the owner has not approved: an unapproved rename would otherwise
fail every caller of a live method with a hint pointing at a name the owner never
approved. A green run is a CONSISTENCY CHECK against that document, never consent to
edit it.

#: that authorises the retirement, quoted VERBATIM (whitespace-normalised).
#:
#: Why a separate cell and not a parse of one fixed sentence shape: the owner's
#: ledger states an approval in three different shapes — a single-name row
#: (`| `events_poll` | → row 11 `poll_events`. |`), a GROUP row
#: (`| `graph_delete`, `graph_restore`, `graph_list`, `graph_set_name` | →
#: rows 30–33 `*_memory_graph*`. |`), and a discarded-row entry that names the
#: destination inline. A parser that accepts only the first shape can never
#: authorise the other 112 renames the same ledger records, so it would block
#: phase 2 permanently. The quote makes each entry's authority explicit and
#: checkable instead of implied by a shape.
#:
#: ⚠️ The residual, stated rather than papered over: a group row names a RANGE
#: of approved targets, so this map's job is to prove the replacement is one of
#: those rows and that the old name is in the row authorising it. WHICH row of
#: the range a given old name collapses into is the author's design decision —
#: no machine can decide that `graph_list` is row 31 rather than row 30 — so the
#: decision is RECORDED in :data:`RETIRED_SDK_APPROVAL_ROWS` and pinned by
#: `tests/test_sdk_retirement.py`, instead of being re-decided at runtime. That
#: cell is not decoration: a range alone would admit a DESTRUCTIVE mis-target
#: (`"graph_list": "delete_memory_graph"` sits inside rows 30–33), whose hint
#: would send every caller to the eraser with a green run.
