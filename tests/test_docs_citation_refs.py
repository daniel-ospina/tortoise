"""#1165 — a pointer INTO a scoping/research record must land on a line of text.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

The #5063 defect class is *a pointer that does not resolve*: a document names the
place its reader must go, and the reference is dangling. PR #11559 fixed exactly
that for the `E1`/`E2` label pointers in the #265 encryption scope — and then
introduced a fresh instance of the same defect in the same commit, in the same
file. Its status/carve-out block inserts 8 lines at the top of
`docs/scoping/2026-08-13-317-cross-encoder-scoping.md`, which shifts every
downstream line by 8. Two documents cite that file's `:98` for the reranker's
`max_length 512` content contract:

  * `docs/scoping/2026-08-13-265-content-encryption-scoping.md:128`
  * `docs/research/2026-08-13-265-encryption/axis-research.md:99`

At that head, line 98 of the target is BLANK. A `#265` revival lane following the
carve-out pointer lands on whitespace — the precise failure the PR's own body
describes as "the #5063 defect class", re-created by the diff that fixes it.

Nothing caught it: markdownlint does not resolve citations, and the `docs` job's
linters see prose, not targets. So the rot is silent, which is what this ends.

THE POLICY IT ENFORCES, AND WHERE THAT POLICY COMES FROM

Citing by NAME is the recorded convention, not this file's invention:

  * `docs/architecture/S2-DECISION-SEAM.md:503` — "assertions by NAME — never by
    line number, and never by row **ordinal**. Both go stale the same way".
  * `docs/evidence/7949-capstone/E1-E5-PROOFS.md:137` — "cited **by title, never
    by line**: a line number ROTS".
  * `tortoise/hosted_api.py:5006` — "Cited by SYMBOL, never by line number (line
    numbers re-stale)".

Sphinx's cross-reference guidance converges on the same rule from outside this
repo: explicit labels (`:ref:`) are preferred over fragile direct links because
labels survive edits and warn when they break.

This test does not ban line numbers — it refuses one that does not land on text.
Any surviving `:NN` pointer **written in one of the two forms it resolves** is
therefore kept HONEST **against the one shift it can see**: insert a section above
it and this reds when the shift lands on whitespace — but a shift onto a
DIFFERENT non-blank line stays green, and the pointer then silently names whatever
row now sits there. (A pointer already past the end of the file is red for its own
reason; no insertion can drive one there.) This is line PRESENCE, not semantic
correctness (see STATED LIMITS). A pointer outside those two forms is not kept
honest at all.

WHY THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE OF THE EXISTING CITATION GUARDS

`tests/test_extractor_v4_citation_rot.py` (#8506) and
`tests/test_extractor_v4_doc_citations.py` (#8498) already hold this instrument,
but neither reads this relation. `citation_rot` resolves a quoted `sym` against a
`file.py:NNNN` whose symbol must still exist in that source file, and it states
the same claim across several design documents declared as module constants
(`DOC`, `STORAGE`, `ONTOLOGY`, `SEARCH`, `ONTOLOGY_CHANGELOG`, `INGEST`,
`EVAL_SPEC`; the asserted set is `FACT_STATEMENTS_IN_SIBLINGS`) rather than one.
`doc_citations` does not use `file.py:NNNN` at all: it pins
that §7's value-gate row names the SHIPPED symbols (`value_gate._REFERENCE` /
`identifier_only()`) and that those symbols behave as the row says. Neither reads
a markdown-to-markdown line pointer, and neither covers `docs/scoping/` or
`docs/research/`, so the regression above was invisible to both. This file is the
same INSTRUMENT over the missing subject, not a second implementation of theirs.
⛔ `citation_rot`'s constants are cited here by NAME, never by line number:
`origin/main` added `SEARCH` below `ONTOLOGY` and shifted **the three constants
declared after it** (`ONTOLOGY_CHANGELOG`, `INGEST`, `EVAL_SPEC` each moved down
4 lines; `DOC`, `STORAGE` and `ONTOLOGY` did not move at all) — the same rot this
file exists to catch, and one it is blind to inside a `.py` docstring (see STATED
LIMITS). An earlier cut of this paragraph cited the ranges `:76-81` and `:248-249`.
Both are dead at the merge result, and `:76-81` was **already off by one at the
head that wrote it**: the range ended at `INGEST` while the sentence listed
`EVAL_SPEC`, which sat at `:82`.

`tests/test_s2_decision_record_5087.py` (#10072) is the closest precedent for the
policy side: its §8 pin reads "§8's rows must cite a sibling mutant or test by
NAME, never by ordinal".
Like both citation guards, this file is DUAL-REGISTERED (`core` + `tier1`) because
a docs-only diff runs `tier1` only — and a docs-only diff is exactly the change
that can move the line numbers a citation depends on.

WHAT IT CHECKS

A citation is reported when its RESOLVED TARGET lies under `docs/scoping/` or
`docs/research/` — the decision-scope and research records whose pointer graph
#1165 exists to keep followable (a disposition that names an issue a reader
cannot find is the #5063 defect the PR body leads with). Two forms are resolved:

  1. a full path — ``docs/....md:NN`` (also ``:NN-MM``; a range's START must be
     non-blank, because a range's span is the author's claim about content and no
     mechanical check can judge it);
  2. the shorthand `` `317` scoping:NN `` / ``317 research:NN``, resolved to the
     single record under `docs/scoping/` / `docs/research/` whose PATH carries
     `<number>` as a `-<number>-` token — hyphen-WRAPPED on both sides. The match
     is on the path's tokens,
     not on a filename glob: `docs/research/` is nested, and the `#265` brief this
     PR edits keeps its number in the DIRECTORY
     (`docs/research/2026-08-13-265-encryption/axis-research.md`).

STATED LIMITS — deliberate, and measured rather than guessed:

  * A bare ``:NN`` continuation (``(`:203`)``) carries no document name, so it
    cannot be resolved in isolation and is NOT checked. A citation meant to
    survive should carry its own name instead of leaning on a preceding one —
    which is why this change introduces NO such pointer: the two sites it touches
    (`docs/scoping/2026-08-13-317-cross-encoder-scoping.md` and its research
    brief) cite the `265` scope doc's wiring table by its `#317 reranker` ROW
    NAME instead of by `:203`.
  * Line PRESENCE is the whole check. A pointer is dead only when its line is
    BLANK or past the end of the file (`_dead_reason`): one that a later insert
    SHIFTS onto a different non-blank line is reported healthy, and it silently
    names whatever row now sits there. Measured at this head, not reasoned about:
    inserting ONE line above the `#160 hosted embeddings` bullet in
    ``docs/scoping/2026-08-13-265-content-encryption-scoping.md``'s
    `### Runtime prerequisites` list (its line 127) shifts the
    ``265 scoping:128`` pointer this change writes onto that bullet — off the
    `#317 cross-encoder reranker` row the pointer names — against the same guard
    that reports 0 problems. (The site matters: an insert above that document's
    WIRING TABLE, ~56 lines below, moves nothing the pointer reads.) Past-EOF is a
    SEPARATE arm and no insertion reaches it — only a pointer already past the end
    of the file, like the ``ONTOLOGY.md:1515`` cite from
    `docs/plans/2026-09-10-ws-c-numeric-normalization.md:501` (enumerated below, with the rest
    of the out-of-scope backlog). Cite a row
    by NAME when it must survive an edit (the policy quoted above); this instrument
    catches the whitespace half of the problem, which is the half that is
    mechanically decidable without inventing a notion of what a row MEANS.
  * The two resolved FORMS are also the instrument's scope, and they are
    narrower than "a pointer into these two directories". A citation written as
    a bare filename with no ``docs/`` prefix (``platform-seams.md:192``), a
    ``docs/``-less relative path (``scoping/....md:98``), or a ``#L98`` fragment
    matches NEITHER regex (``_PATH_REF`` requires the literal ``docs/``,
    ``_SHORT_REF`` requires the ``scoping|research:NN`` shorthand) and is not
    checked even when the target it names is in scope. Measured at the head this
    landed on, one such live citation exists —
    ``docs/research/2026-09-01-gbrain-learnings/platform-seams.md`` cites
    ``platform-landscape.md:192-193``, an in-scope target, and the guard never
    looks at it. What this instrument covers is "every pointer written in the
    two forms above", not "every `:NN` pointer into ``docs/scoping/`` and
    ``docs/research/``".
  * The CITING side is `docs/**/*.md` only (`docs.rglob`). This instrument never
    reads a pointer written inside a `.py` docstring or comment — including one
    of the three policy quotes above, which lives in `tortoise/hosted_api.py` — so
    "the citation graph" here means the graph BETWEEN documents, not every
    citation in the tree.
  * The guard is scoped to those two directories ON PURPOSE. With `_in_scope`
    widened to accept EVERY target under `docs/`, this tree carried **10** further
    dead citations when the disposition was written (measured at `e66450bb`, this
    change's base; paths below are relative to `docs/`: `ONTOLOGY.md` ×4 — three
    blank lines plus one PAST-EOF cite, which is a different repair from a blank
    one — `ops/registry-backup-dr.md` ×2, `infra/embedded-reaper-cron.md`,
    `architecture/STORAGE-ARCHITECTURE.md`,
    `epics/2026-08-03-tortoise-hosted-platform/plans/7714-data-model.md`,
    `epics/1402-eval-battery/01-align.md`). ⛔ WIDENING `_TARGET_SCOPE` ALONE CANNOT
    REPRODUCE THAT TEN, and the recipe matters because someone will run it: that
    constant is matched against the target's SECOND path part, so a ROOT-LEVEL
    target (`docs/ONTOLOGY.md` → `('docs', 'ONTOLOGY.md')`) has no directory there
    and can never be admitted by any set of directory names. Widening
    `_TARGET_SCOPE` to every directory under `docs/` therefore returns **6**, with
    zero `ONTOLOGY.md` rows — a reader who follows the old wording would measure 6
    and "correct" a correct ten.
    ⛔ AND THE TEN IS A HEAD-BOUND READING, NOT A STANDING FACT — and the two that
    `main` moved are NOT repaired. Measured against `origin/main`: the guard stops
    reporting `docs/plans/2026-09-22-2814-rebuild-config-durability.md:270`
    (`ONTOLOGY.md:833` is now the `passes_frequency_gate` table row, not the
    "Tombstone" controlled term) and
    `docs/scoping/2026-10-13-8497-selfhost-journal.md:36`
    (`STORAGE-ARCHITECTURE.md:365` is now the *three movements* "Write:" bullet,
    not "a wiring gap, not a design gap"), because `main` inserted text ABOVE both
    targets. **Both still cite content that is not there** — they are exactly the
    "shift onto a DIFFERENT non-blank line stays green" case this docstring's
    limits name, so a line-number citation cannot distinguish "repaired" from
    "moved". Re-derive the number rather than trusting either one — a count in
    prose re-stales exactly like the line numbers this guard exists to catch. All
    of them are pre-existing and none is a target of #1165. A guard that shipped
    red would be disabled within a day, and repairing this backlog is not this
    change's job — they are tracked under `#5063` ("one binding from a written
    claim to the system it describes"), the shared root this guard is a symptom of,
    AND enumerated row by row in `#11573` so a reader can act on them rather than
    only read the root. Widening the scope is the follow-up once that backlog is
    paid.
