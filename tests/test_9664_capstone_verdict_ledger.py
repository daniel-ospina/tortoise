"""#9664 — the capstone verdict ledger's mechanism, pinned.

`tools/capstone_ledger.py` exists so that the capstone's second acceptance
criterion ("an empty uncovered list is the only clean exit") is a COMPUTED
answer instead of a fresh prose re-read. Three passes over this issue produced
three denominators for the same rows (14 / 18 / 22), so the point of a pin here
is not that a particular row is green — it is that the ROLLUP cannot be talked
around:

  * a ledger whose every row is `verified` exits 0;
  * one uncovered row makes the whole thing exit 2 and NAMES that row;
  * `verified` with no evidence, evidence that is not in the tree, a verdict
    word outside the vocabulary, an unexplained uncovered row, a duplicated id
    and an empty ledger are all INVALID (exit 1) rather than quietly counted —
    because each of those would let a row disappear from the uncovered list
    without anyone deciding it had been covered;
  * the off-switch can never be mistaken for a pass (exit 3, not 0).

The last test pins the REAL committed ledger. It asserts the denominator (22
criteria, and their ids) so that adding or dropping a criterion is a visible
change, and it asserts the uncovered set by id so that a row cannot silently
stop being reported.
