"""#2988 — /health/ready must never block the event loop.

Production, 2026-09-11: every route in the process (``/openapi.json`` included)
timed out for 15 minutes while ``/proc/loadavg`` was 0.01 and the database
answered PING in 0.38s — an idle process blocked on I/O with the loop held.
Cause: ``health_ready`` ran both plane probes as SYNCHRONOUS calls in the
coroutine body, so one stalled socket froze the whole process, and every deploy
curls this endpoint (a self-inflicted outage vector).

Two complementary guards:

* the AST pins — structural, so the old shape cannot come back through a
  refactor that keeps the observable response intact (a behavioural test alone
  cannot see the difference: the response is identical when nothing stalls);
* the behavioural tests — prove the added indirection actually works, and that
  a hung probe is REPORTED (503) instead of waited out.
