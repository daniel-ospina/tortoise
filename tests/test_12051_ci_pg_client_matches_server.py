# tests/test_12051_ci_pg_client_matches_server.py
"""#12051: the record drill's PostgreSQL **client** major must equal the servers' major.

The D8 drill dumps the record with `pg_dump` and restores it with `pg_restore`,
and `tortoise/record_backup.py` resolves BOTH from `PATH` (the parameters are
the bare names — `pg_dump: str = "pg_dump"`). The archive is not
version-neutral: `pg_dump` writes a preamble the RESTORE SERVER must be able to
execute, so a client whose major is newer than the restore target produces an
artifact that raises on its own header.

Measured 2026-11-12, job `130998952949` (PR #12030, head `3408c76c2b`):

    pg_restore: error: could not execute query: ERROR:  unrecognized
      configuration parameter "transaction_timeout"
    Command was: SET transaction_timeout = 0;

`transaction_timeout` is a **PostgreSQL 17** GUC, the runner's inherited client
was 17, and both provisioned servers are `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`. Nothing in
the diff caused it, and the message reads as a defect in the record path — which
is why the pin is ASSERTED in the job (`pg_dump --version` / `pg_restore
--version`, `::error::` + `exit 1`) rather than merely hoped for.

This guard pins three things about `test-record-postgres`, none of which the
other CI-surface guards cover:

1. **The two image pins agree** (the record server and D8's scratch server must
   be one major — the drill restores across them).
2. **The client pin names that same major**, and prepends its versioned
   `/usr/lib/postgresql/<major>/bin` to `$GITHUB_PATH` — an unversioned install
   would leave the runner's own, newer client first on `PATH`.
3. **The pin runs BEFORE the leg**, because `$GITHUB_PATH` only affects
   subsequent steps: a pin placed after the pytest step is inert, and the job
   would red for a reason no diff explains.

A behavioural test of the mismatch itself would need two live servers and two
client majors, so the assertion is made where the version is decided: the
workflow. Reproduced by hand (documented on #12051): a PG17 client dumping into
`pgvector/pgvector:pg16` fails with exactly the error quoted above, and the same
server's own PG16 client dumps and restores clean.

    comparison literal is therefore pinned to the servers' major, and the "
    announce/stop pair is matched as WHOLE LINES rather than substrings (round
    7): `false && exit 1` and `bail() { exit 1; }` contain the stop and never
    take it.

    STATED LIMIT: the branch must be FLAT (`FAIL_CLOSED_BRANCH_RE`) — a nested
    conditional inside it is refused rather than reasoned about, because a
    hermetic text guard cannot prove a nested branch is reachable. An
    `if … else … fi` variant is refused for the same reason; there is no such
    branch in the real step.

    STATED LIMIT: this is a hermetic text guard, so it cannot prove the
    version-EXTRACTION arithmetic — a `sed` rewritten to a constant (`s/.*/16/`)
    still passes. The alternative is arming two real client majors in CI, which
    this job cannot do without provisioning a second client version; the
    in-job assertion (`pg_dump --version` printed and checked) is what makes a
    constant extraction visible in the log instead.
