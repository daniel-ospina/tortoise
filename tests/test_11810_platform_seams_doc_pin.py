"""#11810 review (P2) — `platform-seams.md` and the shipped install message cannot drift apart.

WHY THIS PIN EXISTS. `docs/research/2026-09-01-gbrain-learnings/platform-seams.md` §3
cites the `tortoise install cursor` message as the evidence that the cloud-agent
exclusion is **HOSTED**-scoped, and that record is what a future lane cites for
#11807. The r6 review measured the drift in the DOC direction: the record quoted
*"a session running in a cloud agent VM"* — the UNSCOPED universal #11806 carried
and this PR removes — while the shipped message says *"in a HOSTED cloud agent VM"*.
A fragment in double quotes that is not in its source reads as evidence FOR the
over-assertion it sits next to.

WHY ITS OWN FILE, REGISTERED IN `tier1` (as well as `api` and `core`). The guarded
artifact is under `docs/`, and `docs/` is in `NON_PYTHON_PREFIXES`, so a
**docs-only** diff selects NO surface and takes the tier1-only early return. The pin
originally shipped inside `tests/test_capture_install.py` — which is registered on
`api` + `core` and NOT in `tier1` — so on a docs-only edit of this very record it ran
**zero times**: a lane doing #11807's doc half could restore the unscoped quote,
merge green, and only red `main` post-merge (the `push` build takes the full
selection). That is the #4309/#8474/#8614 class, and every sibling doc pin
(`test_10000_cache_projection_doc_pin.py`, `test_10191_record_move_doc_pin.py`,
`test_8093_registry_namespace_doc.py`, …) is dual/triple-registered for exactly this
reason.

`api` is not decoration either: a change to `tortoise/__main__.py` matches
`SOURCE_PATTERNS["api"]`, which REPLACES the `core` fallback — measured,
`printf 'tortoise/__main__.py\\n' | tools/ci_selection.py --changed-files -` →
`surfaces: ['api']`. Without the `api` row the message-direction arm would sleep on
the only diff that can break it.

WHAT IT ASSERTS, in BOTH directions:

  (1) the record quotes the HOSTED-scoped fragment, and the unscoped shape does not
      reappear as a QUOTED fragment — the r6 defect;
  (2) the shipped message really contains the fragment the record quotes — so
      dropping `hosted` from the message (or restoring the unscoped quote in the
      record) REDs instead of passing silently.

`_SHIPPED_FRAGMENT` is the single string both arms bind to, so the two cannot be
corrected in opposite directions without this file noticing.

MUTATION (each verified RED at this head, restoring byte-identical):
  * restore the unscoped quote at `platform-seams.md:315`      → (1) RED
  * drop `hosted` from `tortoise/__main__.py`'s message         → (2) RED
  * delete the record's quoted sentence                         → (1) RED
