"""E2E-1 source-level guard (#770 — plan Task 2): the tenant-provision Edge
Function must write the master list into Supabase ONLY.

The live E2E-1 registry assertion (registry_control_plane node count == 0
after signup) runs in the pre-deploy gate (plan Task 10). This test guards
the same contract at the source level so a regression can never ship: the
Edge Function must call provision_team (the atomic Supabase RPC), must NOT
call /internal/provision (the old registry writer) or update_user_team (the
old membership writer), must keep the data-plane demo seed, and must compute
lookup_hash via the shared TS mirror (parity with tortoise/auth.py).
