"""#10360 — the verbatim state-value guarantee, enforced in the WRITE PATH.

What this file pins, and why each pin is here rather than in a comment:

1. **The rule.** ``_value_slot_divergence`` fires exactly on a same-slot
   contradiction (the point states a DIFFERENT value than its own verbatim
   quote in the slot the quote binds) and fails open everywhere else. The
   tolerance battery below is the one the previous attempt at this issue was
   rejected for failing: string identity refused truthful points for
   ``4.0``/``4``, ``1200``/``1,200``, ``20%``/``20 percent``,
   ``800ms``/``800 milliseconds`` and ``03:00``/``3am`` (review P1s 1–2, #10360
   lane record §6). A guard that accuses a truthful point of a rewrite it did
   not commit is worse than no guard: it withholds a durable memory.
2. **The enforcement, at the emit site.** ``execute_embed`` does not write a
   point whose value contradicts its own quote. This is the pin that fails if
   the rule is DELETED from the write path (mutation-checked in the lane
   record): asserting the pure function alone would be machinery, not proof.
3. **The invariant the guarantee cannot break.** A point whose value IS
   verbatim survives — untouched, with its span — so this rule can never be
   read as a filter that drops state values.
4. **The other invariant, which this rule must not disturb.** The selection
   predicate ``value_gate.identifier_only`` (#4899) still drops
   identifier-like residues. Retention must not re-admit the identifiers that
   filter was built to remove, so both halves are asserted together.
