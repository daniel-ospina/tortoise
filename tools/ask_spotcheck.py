"""#1987 Task 12 (b)/(d): product-lane known-answer smoke + QA spot-check.

Runs the REAL product lane (``sdk.ask`` → ``build_reader_model`` — the
RoutingModel transport delta vs the eval's OpenAICompatModel) over:
  * (b) the gold-verbatim known-answer fixture (MUST commit),
  * (d) a bounded QA spot-check over real LongMemEval dataset questions
    (temporal / preference / KU / MSR / abstention (_abs) /
    single-session-assistant samples — the plan's composition).

Usage notes (#2280):
  * Run with a STRONG, non-collapsing reader — the ask lane escalates its
    output budget once when a reasoning model collapses to empty output
    (``TORTOISE_ASK_ESCALATION_TOKENS``, default 2000), but a capable
    model is the point of the measurement: ``TORTOISE_ASK_MODEL=qwen/
    qwen3.8-max`` (family-prefixed, #2069).
  * The run also prints a ctx gold-session recall readout (retrieval
    measured SEPARATELY from reading — every gold session present in the
    evidence the reader saw), so a retrieval regression is never masked
    as a reading miss.

Grading (issue #2071 owner decision 2026-08-31 — full semantic): EVERY
question is graded by the benchmark-standard semantic judge
(``build_judge()`` → the official gpt-4o anscheck judge — the same judge
the graded eval lane uses for every question). The old word-overlap bar
(``max(2, len(gold_words)//2)`` on UNIQUE words) is REMOVED from this
path — it was structurally unreachable for the 3 SSP long-gold questions
(d6233ab6 79w / 1d4e3b97 68w / b0479f84 63w; a correct paraphrase never
clears a ≥½-unique-word overlap bar) and is demoted to the key-free CI
(MockJudge) substitute only. The ``_abs`` marker path is unchanged and
precedes the judge call (a deterministic short-circuit for
abstained-with-marker answers; any other ``_abs`` answer falls through to
the judge's abstention template). There is NO silent fallback to the
removed bar: the tool exits fail-fast (before any grading) when the judge
provider key is absent (see ``_require_judge_key``).

Requires live provider keys: DEEPSEEK_API_KEY / OPENROUTER_API_KEY /
VENICE_API_KEY for the reader AND the judge provider key
(``TORTOISE_LME_JUDGE_MODEL`` — default ``openai:gpt-4o-2024-08-06`` →
``OPENAI_API_KEY``) for grading. Seeding reproduces the memory the
question was asked about: one Point per haystack turn + an Event per
session (startedAt from haystack_dates) so the ask lane's annotation
renders session dates.

Composition fixture: the committed ``tests/fixtures/ask_spotcheck_composition.json``
(21 questions — the reproducibility gap closed by issue #2071 step 1).
Path resolution order: ``--fixture`` CLI arg → ``TORTOISE_SPOTCHECK_FIXTURE``
env → committed fixture → ``/tmp/ask_spotcheck.json`` (legacy compat).
