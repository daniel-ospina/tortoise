# Archive index — code removed from the product surface

An archived symbol is **out of the product**: it is not importable from `tortoise`, it
is not served on the MCP surface, and no retired-forward name points at it. The code
is kept here so a removal can be inspected and — if it was a mistake — read back.
The mechanism and its rules: [`README.md`](README.md).
